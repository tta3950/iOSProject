Designated Driver App

Overview:

Drinking and driving is  a problem that is slowly becoming less and less widespread. This is because of many ride sharing apps, such as Uber, Lyft, and some area specific programs. The main reason for us making this app is to demonstrate how a ride sharing app specifically targeted to Northwest Missouri State University students could look like.

Features:

Description                                                                                         Status

What Could Improve:

The UI could be more expressive and creative.
The map view could possible be used to show where the driver/rider is at. in addition to be fully implemented.
